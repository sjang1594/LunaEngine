### Prerequsite 

In order to build this project and generate a solution, you need to download [premake5](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake/).  
Then download `premake5.exe` into the `vendor/bin`.  
Since there is a license to premake, it's good practice to attach `premake5` license.txt.
